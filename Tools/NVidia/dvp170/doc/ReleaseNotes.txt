Release Highlights
==================================================

NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video version 1.51 features:
* Added file details in the properties dialog box for dvp.dll
* Removed references to DLLMain and WndProc from dvp_static.lib
* Fixed bug where DVP library initialization fails searching for 
  an English string when there are no English strings on the system
* Linking to the static library now requires the DVP_STATIC compiler flag


NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video version 1.46 features:
* Fixed library memory usage and memory leaks
* Improved library error reporting. Added new return values for the following functions:
	- dvpGetRequiredConstants*: DVP_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY
	- dvpFreeSyncObject:DVP_STATUS_SYNC_STILL_BOUND
* Updates to the Programming Guide: More detailed guidance on DirectX, context requirements and performance caveats.
* Updates to the SDK samples including:
- Added moving green/red/blue test data bars to allow tearing test
- Added display mode for tearing test, this creates a fullscreen window
- Modified constant ring buffer sizes in the shared code
- Added some basic tracing code
- Added optimal handling on batches of frames   (see  extBeginFrame of extBeginFrame)
- Added support for Tesla K10 and K20 GPUs


NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video version 1.3.8 features:
* Changed SDK version number to match the DVP library version
  in DVPAPI.h.
* Small updates to the Programming Guide.
* The use of dvpBegin and dvpEnd is now required around calls to
  dvpSyncObjClientWait for more efficient batched operations.
* The library now works correctly with OpenGL SLI contexts


NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video version 1.2.1 features:
* The use of dvpBegin and dvpEnd is now required around calls to
  dvpSyncObjClientWait for more efficient batched operations.
* Fixes memory leak in dvpGetRequiredConstantsD3D9Device
* Fixes dvpCreateGPUD3D9Resource crash when D3D9 device is created
  with adapter ordinal of 1 or greater.
* Fixes problem where dvpSyncObjectClientWait* was not waiting 
  in the case of OpenGL and DirectX.
* Fixes crash in dvpSyncObjectClientWait* on Linux.


NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video version 1.2 features:
* Performance optimizations
* SDK sample fixes and cleanup: shutdown, resources deallocation, chunking
* Updated programming guide
* Added support for Tesla boards and Kepler Quadro boards.
* Removed the stride alignment restriction and made it a recommendation instead.
* Added CUDA stream synchronization API entry points.
* Added DVP buffer format types specifically for CUDA arrays
* All SDK samples now can demonstrate how to use buffers in addition to textures with GPU Direct for Video.  Note, in the case of DX only the D3D9 path has been verified.  In each sample, this can be enabled by uncommenting USE_BUFFERS.
* Added DVP_HALF_FLOAT type and error checks so DVP_BUFFER types are not used with dvpMemcpy2D/dvpMemcpyLined and vice versa. 
* Added a static library version of the DVP library
* Combined the core linux and windows SDK files into a single module


NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video version 1.1 features:
* NVIDIA GPU Direct for Video Library and Header Files
* Pseudo SDK that demonstrates GPU Direct for Video API Usage
* OpenGL, CUDA, DirectX 9 and DirectX 11 application code examples 
* Linux support
