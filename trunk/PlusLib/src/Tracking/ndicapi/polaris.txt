These two header files provide backwards-compatibility for support
of the POLARIS optical tracking device from Northern Digital Inc.
through the ndicapi library supplied by Atamai Inc.

This C API is based very closely on the POLARIS 1.0 serial
communications API published by Northern Digital Inc.  Its primary
purpose is to provide a straightforward C-language programming
interface that is portable across all common computing platforms.
