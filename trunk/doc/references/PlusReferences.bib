This is reverse-tri-linear interpolation. A single pixel is distributed over 8 neighboring voxels. 
This is implemented in our software, though reconstructions do not turn out as nice when we apply hole-filling with this, possibly because of unequal weighting.
The last few paragraphs of 2.1 are interesting: they use the same ultrasound resolutions as us, but claim that hole-less is easy to accomplish. This isn't an RBF but could be with a larger kernel (not too sure about this last point, reread later?)},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a novel method for ultrasound calibration for both spatial and temporal parameters. The main advantage of this method is that it does not require a phantom, which is usually expensive to fabricate. Furthermore, the method does not require extensive image processing. For spatial calibration, we solve an optimization problem established by a set of equations that relate the orientations of a line (i.e., calibration pointer) to the intersection points appearing in the ultrasound image. The line orientation is provided through calibration of both ends of the calibration pointer. Temporal calibration is achieved by processing of the captured pointer orientations and the corresponding image positions of intersection along with the timing information. The effectiveness of the unified method for both spatial and temporal calibration is apparent from the quality of the 3D reconstructions of a known object.},

  Abstract                 = {Echography is a useful tool to diagnose a thrombosis; however, since it is difficult to learn to perform this procedure, the objective of this work is to create a simulation to allow students to practice in a virtual environment. Firstly, a physical model of the thigh was constructed based on experimental data obtained using a force sensor mounted on a robotic arm. We present a spring damper model consisting of both linear and non-linear elements. The parameters of each of these elements are then fitted to the experimental data using an optimization technique. By employing an implicit integration to solve the dynamics of the system we obtain a stable physical simulation at over 100 Hz. Secondly, a haptic interface was added to interact with the simulation. Using a PHANToM force-feedback device may touch and deform the thigh in real-time. In order to allow a realistic sensation of the contact we employ a local modeling technique allowing to approximate the forces at much higher frequency using a multi-threaded architecture. Finally, we present the basis for a fast echographic image generation depending on the position and orientation of the virtual probe as well as the force applied to it.},

  Abstract                 = {Tracking the position and orientation of a 3-D ultrasound transducer has many clinical applications. Tracking requires calibration to find the transformation between the tracking sensor and the ultrasound coordinates. Typically the set of image slice data are scan converted to a Cartesian volume using assumed motor geometry and a single transformation to the sensor. We propose, instead, the calibration of individual slices using a 2-D calibration technique. A best fit to a subset of slices is performed to decrease data collection time compared with that for calibration of all slices, and to reduce the influence of random errors in individual calibrations. We compare our technique with four scan conversion-based techniques: 2-D N-wire on the center slice, N-wire using a 3-D volume, N-wire using a 3-D volume including the edge points and a new closed-form planar method using a 3-D volume. The proposed multi-slice technique produced the smallest point reconstruction error (0.82 mm using a tracked stylus).},

These procedures require careful placement of a needle to ensure effective delivery of anesthetics and to avoid damaging sensitive tissue such as nerves. In this system, a trinocular camera tracks an ultrasound transducer during the acquisition of a sequence of B-mode images. The system generates an ultrasound panorama image of the lumbar spine, automatically identifies the lumbar levels in the panorama image, and overlays the identified levels on a live camera view of the patient's back. Validation is performed to test the accuracy of panorama generation, lumbar level identification, overall system accuracy, and the effect of changes in the curvature of the spine during the examination. The results from 17 subjects demonstrate the feasibility and capability of achieving an error within clinically acceptable range for epidural anaesthesia.},

  Abstract                 = {Four-dimensional imaging is a necessary step in computer-assisted interventions (CAI) performed on moving surgical targets, such as those located within the beating heart or influenced by respiratory motion. Ultrasound (US) is often the best imaging modality for this application, as it provides good contrast and spatial resolution while remaining simple to integrate into the operating room. However, conventional 2D US imaging is often insufficient for preoperative planning and surgical guidance, real-time 3D ultrasound imaging using matrix array probes has a smaller field of view and lower spatial resolution, and 3D volumes created using 3D US reconstruction suffer from motion artifacts. As an alternative, gated 4D ultrasound reconstruction using a tracked 2D US probe is a promising technology. In this paper, we present SynchroGrab4D to the open-source community. SynchroGrab4D performs 3D and 4D US reconstruction in real-time while visualizing the output volume(s) within an OpenIGTLink-compliant CAI system, such as 3D Slicer. Also included are VTK classes that perform ECG-gating and that interface with several commercial tracking systems, as well as a 4D Imaging module in 3D Slicer. Our open-source imaging system can be used to collect the 4D image data required for computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance for a variety of moving organs.},

There is mention of "improving" the quality of the 2D images, but it is unclear what is meant by this.
Used electromagnetic position and orientation sensor
Analog->Digital transformation of US images?
Describes a reconstruction algorithm that is essentially each voxel inserted over a kernel region using a distance weight
Quality measure, volumes inside surface models?
I did not understand the quality metric (if any?) that was used for "image quality" = "coherence". The paper seemed to argue that using 66 values to compute a single voxel is preferable to one. I think blurrier may have been better in this context? not sure. *** ask Andras about this
Most of the paper seemed to be oriented towards inserting the pixels into the volume},

  Abstract                 = {   Ultrasound is prevalent in image-guided therapy as a safe, inexpensive, and widely available imaging modality. However, extensive training in interpreting ultrasound images is essential for successful procedures. An open-source ultrasound image simulator was developed to facilitate the training of ultrasound-guided spinal intervention procedures, thereby eliminating the need for an ultrasound machine from the phantom-based training environment.   Anatomical structures and surgical tools are converted to surface meshes for data compression. Anatomical data are converted from segmented volumetric images, while the geometry of surgical tools is available as a surface mesh. The pose of the objects are either constants or coming from a pose-tracking device. Intersection points between the surface models and the ultrasound scan lines are determined with a binary space partitioning tree. The scan lines are divided into segments and filled with gray values determined by an intensity calculation accounting for material properties, reflection, and attenuation parameters defined in a configuration file. The scan lines are finally converted to a regular brightness-mode ultrasound image.   The simulator was tested in a tracked ultrasound imaging system, with a mock transducer tracked with an Ascension trakSTAR electromagnetic tracker, on a spine phantom. A mesh model of the spine was created from CT data. The simulated ultrasound images were generated at a speed of 50 frames per second, and a resolution of [Formula: see text] pixels, with 256 scan lines per frame, on a PC with a 3.4 GHz processor. A human subject trial was conducted to compare the learning performance of novice trainees, with real and simulated ultrasound, in the localization of facet joints of a spine phantom. With 22 participants split into two equal groups, and each participant localizing 6 facet joints, there was no statistical difference in the performance of the two groups, indicating that simulated ultrasound could indeed replace the real ultrasound in phantom-based ultrasonography training for spinal interventions.   The ultrasound simulator was implemented and integrated into the open-source Public Library for Ultrasound (PLUS) toolkit.},

  Abstract                 = {Although ultrasound has become an important imaging modality within several medical professions, the benefit of ultrasound depends to some degree on the skills of the person operating the probe and interpreting the image. For some applications, the possibility to educate operators in a clinical setting is limited, and the use of training simulators is considered an alternative approach for learning basic skills. To ensure the quality of simulator-based training, it is important to produce simulated ultrasound images that resemble true images to a sufficient degree. This article describes a method that allows corresponding true and simulated ultrasound images to be generated and displayed side by side in real time, thus facilitating an interactive evaluation of ultrasound simulators in terms of image resemblance, real-time characteristics and man-machine interaction. The proposed method could be used to study the realism of ultrasound simulators and how this realism affects the quality of training, as well as being a valuable tool in the development of simulation algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {   Freehand tracked ultrasound imaging is an inexpensive non-invasive technique used in several guided interventions. This technique requires spatial calibration between the tracker and the ultrasound image plane. Several calibration devices (a.k.a. phantoms) use N-wires that are convenient for automatic procedures since the segmentation of fiducials in the images and the localization of the middle wires in space are straightforward and can be performed in real time. The procedures reported in literature consider only the spatial position of the middle wire. We investigate if better results can be achieved if the information of all the wires is equally taken into account. We also evaluated the precision and accuracy of the implemented methods to allow comparison with other methods.   We consider a cost function based on the in-plane errors between the intersection of all the wires with the image plane and their respective segmented points in the image. This cost function is minimized iteratively starting from a seed computed with a closed-form solution based on the middle wires.   Mean calibration precision achieved with the N-wire phantom was about 0.5 mm using a shallow probe, and mean accuracy was around 1.4 mm with all implemented methods. Precision was about 2.0 mm using a deep probe.   Precision and accuracy achieved with the N-wire phantom and a shallow probe are at least comparable to that obtained with other methods traditionally considered more precise. Calibration using N-wires can be done more consistently if the parameters are optimized with the proposed cost function.},

In a freehand US imaging system, US probe calibration is typically required to construct a 3D image of the patient's anatomy from a set of 2D US images. Most of the current calibration techniques concern primarily with the precision and accuracy. However, for computer-assisted surgeries that may require a calibration task inside the operating room (OR), many other important aspects have to be considered besides accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel system for automated calibration that is optimized for the OR usage with real-time feedback and control of the calibration accuracy. We have also designed a novel N-wire phantom, with greatly reduced complexity to facilitate mass production without compromising the accuracy and robustness.},

Extensive validations were conducted on a data set of 10,000 images in 50 independent calibration trials to thoroughly investigate the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the calibration system. On average, the calibration accuracy (measured in three-dimensional reconstruction error against a known ground truth) of all 50 trials was 0.66 mm. In addition, the calibration errors converged to submillimeter in 98\% of all trials within 12.5 s on average. Overall, the calibration system was able to consistently, efficiently and robustly achieve high calibration accuracy with real-time performance.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a groupwise US to CT registration algorithm for guiding percutaneous spinal interventions. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive validation scheme that accounts for changes in the curvature of the spine between preoperative and intraoperative imaging. In our registration methodology, each vertebra in CT is treated as a sub-volume and transformed individually. A biomechanical model is used to constrain the displacement of the vertebrae relative to one another. The sub-volumes are then reconstructed into a single volume. During each iteration of registration, an US image is simulated from the reconstructed CT volume and an intensity-based similarity metric is calculated with the real US image. Validation studies are performed on CT and US images from a sheep cadaver, five patient-based phantoms designed to preserve realistic curvatures of the spine and a sixth patient-based phantom where the curvature of the spine is changed between preoperative and intraoperative imaging. For datasets where the spine curve between two imaging modalities was artificially perturbed, the proposed methodology was able to register initial misalignments of up to 20mm with a success rate of 95\%. For the phantom with a physical change in the curvature of the spine introduced between the US and CT datasets, the registration success rate was 98.5\%. Finally, the registration success rate for the sheep cadaver with soft-tissue information was 87\%. The results demonstrate that our algorithm allows for robust registration of US and CT datasets, regardless of a change in the patients pose between preoperative and intraoperative image acquisitions.},

  Abstract                 = {All freehand 3-D ultrasound systems have some latency between the acquisition of an image and its associated position. Previously, estimation of latency has been made by tracking a phantom in a sequence of images and correlating its motion to that recorded by the position sensor. However, tracking-based temporal calibration uses the assumption that latency is constant between scans. This paper presents a new method for temporal calibration that avoids this assumption. Temporal calibration is performed on the scan data by finding the latency at which the best alignment of the 2-D images within the reconstructed volume occurs. The mean voxel intensity variance is used as a global measure of the quality of alignment within the volume and is minimized with respect to latency for each scan. The new method is compared with previous methods using an ultrasound phantom. Finally, integration of temporal calibration with existing spatial calibration methods is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Z-fiducial phantoms allow three-dimensional ultrasound probe calibration with a single B-scan. One of the main difficulties in using this phantom is the need for reliable segmentation of the wires in the ultrasound images, which necessitates manual intervention. In this article, we have shown how we can solve this problem by mounting a thin rubber membrane on top of the phantom. The membrane is segmented automatically and the wires can be easily located as they are at known positions relative to the membrane. This enables us to segment the wires automatically at the full PAL frame rate of 25 Hz, to produce calibrations in real-time, while achieving accuracies similar to those reported in the literature. We have also devised a technique to improve the estimation of the elevational offset (calibration parameter) by capturing a few images of the planar membrane. If spatial calibration is known, fully automatic wire segmentation allows the fiducials to be tracked in real-time. This also enables temporal calibration to be performed in real-time as the probe is moved away from the phantom. We have evaluated the performance of our phantom by calibrating a probe at 8 cm and 15 cm depth. The precision of the calibrations are 0.7 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. The point reconstruction accuracies of fiducial points provided by the same Z-phantom are slightly below 1.5 mm. The point reconstruction accuracies obtained by scanning the end of a wire tip are 2.5 mm and 3.0 mm. These results match the accuracies achieved in the literature. It takes approximately 2 min to set up the experiment, submerge the phantom in the water bath, locate the phantom in space with a pointer and capture six images of the planar membrane. After this, spatial calibration can be performed in less than a second. Temporal calibration can be completed in approximately 3 s.},

The improvements are designed to make it easier for inexperienced users to perform plane-based calibration and to know that they have got a reliable result. In particular, we enable the calibration to be performed using water at room temperature while producing a result that is valid for average soft tissue and we show how it is possible to provide feedback on the reliability of the calibration using a metric based on the curvature of the calibration criterion function. We present comprehensive results showing that these innovations improve the precision of the calibration and offer useful feedback to the user.},

The detection of the bedding-caused tissue shift is essential for a safe orientation for the surgeons' new endoscopic operation procedures in neck surgery. It is essential to visualize the relation between important anatomic landmarks and operation instruments at any time. Within the scientific project SACAS we focus on developing an ultrasound supported navigation system based on preoperative imaging which considers the intraoperative tissue shift. A rotatable, flexible neck-model provides the basis for our analyses to evaluate the tissue shift and to invent the new navigation system for endoscopic neck surgery. The total registration error of the system was 2 mm.},

"Although a real-time visualization based on raw B-scans (without any prior reconstruction) is possible and allows online diagnosis (Prager et al. 1999) and, despite the existence of efforts of authors (Treece et al. 1999, 2000, 2001) to do signal processing directly on the raw data, a regular grid is still needed to apply further processing with off-the-shelf algorithms."

Uses the same error metrics as us (MAE and visual assessment)
The data preparation method is different (Artificially removing data vs. removing input slices)

Uses a modified Gaussian convolution filter based on Meirs et al (2000). They use the variance of the surrounding voxels, but I do not understand the intuition behind this, nor do I see any explanation in the paper.

The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is always done such that 98.76% of the data is kept. See Trucci.

Gaussian convolution is shown to not perform as well on larger holes, but performs very well on small holes.

  Abstract                 = {Medical ultrasound imaging has been in clinical use for decades, however, acquisition
and interpretation of ultrasound images still requires experience. For this reason, ultrasound
simulation for training purposes is gaining importance. Additionally, simulated images can
be used for the multimodal registration of Ultrasound and Computed Tomography (CT)
images. The simulation process is a computationally demanding task. Thus, in this thesis a
simulation method, accelerated by modern graphics hardware (GPU), is introduced.

The accelerated simulation utilizes a ray-based simulation model in order to provide realtime
high-throughput image simulation for training and registration purposes. Wave-based
simulation methods are computationally even more demanding and have been considered
unsuitable for real-time applications. In the scope of this thesis, wave-based models have
been investigated, including the Digital Waveguide Mesh and the Finite-Difference Time-
Domain method for solvingWestervelts equation. Initial results demonstrate the feasibility
of performing near real-time wave-based ultrasound simulation using graphics hardware.

Furthermore, a new algorithm is introduced for volumetric reconstruction of freehand
(3D) ultrasound. The proposed algorithm intelligently divides the work between CPU and
GPU for optimal performance. The results demonstrate superior performance and equivalent
reconstruction quality compared to existing state of the art methods. GPU accelerated
ultrasound simulation and freehand volume reconstruction are key components for fast 3D-
3D (dense deformable) multimodal registration of Ultrasound and CT images, which is subject
of current ongoing work.},

Good:
 I like the idea of implanting a marker with the needle guide and scan it
 The targeting experiments are nice

Bad:
 They use commercial (Amira) and proprietary (custom TCP/IP protocol instead of OpenIGTLink) software modules instead of open-source
 Sequential optimization of scaling, rotation, and offset increases the error, as an error in the estimation of one component causes error in other components; they should repeat the sequential optimization many times, or even better they should optimize all the unknown parameters simultaneously
 They think that the non-square pixels are caused by the framegrabber digitization (while its due to speed of sound mismatch)
 They use the pixel spacing reported by the US machine
 The isocenter (center of the transducer) does not remain at the same place on all ultrasound systems, so such isocenter point may not exist
 For me it seems that the linearization of the non-linear optimization problem and the iterative solution is basically a naïve non-linear iterative optimizer implementation  I think its better to use a standard non-linear optimizer (developed, tested, and optimized by many smart people over many years)
 Strange and error-prone that half of the calibration (probe calibration) is done in water, while the other half (needle guide calibration) is done in gel
 They should have used standard accuracy and precision measurement (using independent point target and repeated calibrations) instead of trying to find out something from reconstructing a volume},

  Abstract                 = {A variety of advanced image analysis methods have been under development for ultrasound-guided interventions. Unfortunately, the transition from an image analysis algorithm to clinical feasibility trials as part of an intervention system requires integration of many components, such as imaging and tracking devices, data processing algorithms, and visualization software. The objective of our work is to provide a freely available open-source software platform - PLUS: Public software Library for Ultrasound - to facilitate rapid prototyping of ultrasoundguided intervention systems for translational clinical research. PLUS provides a variety of methods for interventional tool pose and ultrasound image acquisition from a wide range of tracking and imaging devices, spatial and temporal calibration, volume reconstruction, simulated image generation, and recording and live streaming of the acquired data. This paper introduces PLUS, explains its functionality and architecture, and presents typical uses and performance in ultrasound-guided intervention systems. PLUS fulfills the essential requirements for the development of ultrasound-guided intervention systems and it aspires to become a widely used translational research prototyping platform. PLUS is freely available as open source under BSD license, the code and documentation are available at http://www.plustoolkit.org.},

This paper presents an integrated system developed by the integration of two open-source software (IGSTK and MITK) to shorten the development cycle of the image-guided surgery navigation system and save human resources simultaneously. An image-guided surgery navigation system was established by connecting the two aforementioned open-source software libraries. It used the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) as a framework providing image processing tools for the image-guided surgery navigation system of medical imaging software with a high degree of interaction and used the Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK) as a library that provided the basic components of the system for location, tracking, and registration. The electromagnetic tracking device was used to measure the real-time position of surgical tools and fiducials attached to the patient's anatomy. IGSTK was integrated into MITK; at the same time, the compatibility and the stability of this system were emphasized. Experiments showed that an integrated system of the image-guided surgery navigation system could be developed in 2 months. The integration of IGSTK into MITK is feasible. Several techniques for 3D reconstruction, geometric analysis, mesh generation, and surface data analysis for medical image analysis of MITK can connect with the techniques for location, tracking, and registration of IGSTK. This integration of advanced modalities can decrease software development time and emphasize the precision, safety, and robustness of the image-guided surgery navigation system.},

  Abstract                 = {   Intra-procedural acquisition of the patient anatomy is a key technique in the context of computer-assisted interventions (CAI). Ultrasound (US) offers major advantages as an interventional imaging modality because it is real time and low cost and does not expose the patient or physician to harmful radiation. To advance US-related research, the purpose of this paper was to develop and evaluate an open-source framework for US-based CAI applications.   We developed the open-source software module MITK-US for acquiring and processing US data as part of the well-known medical imaging interaction toolkit (MITK). To demonstrate its utility, we applied the module to implement a new concept for US-guided needle insertion. Performance of the US module was assessed by determining frame rate and latency for both a simple sample application and a more complex needle guidance system.   MITK-US has successfully been used to implement both sample applications. Modern laptops achieve frame rates above 24 frames per second. Latency is measured to be approximately 250 ms or less.   MITK-US can be considered a viable rapid prototyping environment for US-based CAI applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrasound has become indispensable in prenatal diagnosis. Ultrasound training, however, still lacks proper quality assessment and control. Moreover, most fetal anomalies which must be diagnosed during pregnancy are extremely rare. Ultrasound simulators could provide an opportunity to overcome this dilemma. This review summarizes the potential benefits of simulator-based ultrasound training, briefly describes the properties of a variety of ultrasound simulators that have been developed for various applications including prenatal diagnosis, and presents the SonoTrainer sonography simulation system which makes it possible to run a real-time simulation of a complete prenatal ultrasound examination. We evaluated the system for the training of first- and second-trimester screening for both normal and pathological findings and found that physicians who received theoretical training and were additionally trained with the simulator (T + S) significantly improved their skills in measurements of nuchal translucency thickness (NT) and crown-rump length (CRL) as compared with colleagues who only underwent theoretical instruction (T) [mean +/- SD NT deviation: 0.31 +/- 0.1 mm (T + S) vs. 0.62 +/- 0.2 mm (T), P < 0.05; mean +/- SD CRL deviation: 1.48 +/- 2.0 mm (T + S) vs. 3.27 +/- 2.5 (T), P < 0.05]. Simulator-based training enabled physicians to diagnose rare fetal anomalies in the second trimester with a sensitivity of 86\% and a specificity of 100\%. In a study in which second-trimester scans including fetal anomalies were presented to physicians, 96\% of the participants subjectively estimated their training effect as being good. We therefore conclude that simulator-based training would provide an ideal educational tool to test, improve and monitor a physician's or technician's ultrasound skills in detecting fetal anomalies.},

  Abstract                 = {Gynecologic malignancies, including cervical, endometrial, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar cancers, cause significant mortality in women worldwide. The standard care for many primary and recurrent gynecologic cancers consists of chemoradiation followed by brachytherapy. In high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, intracavitary applicators and /or interstitial needles are placed directly inside the cancerous tissue so as to provide catheters to deliver high doses of radiation. Although technology for the navigation of catheters and needles is well developed for procedures such as prostate biopsy, brain biopsy, and cardiac ablation, it is notably lacking for gynecologic HDR brachytherapy. Using a benchtop study that closely mimics the clinical interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy procedure, we developed a method for evaluating the accuracy of image-guided catheter placement. Future bedside translation of this technology offers the potential benefit of maximizing tumor coverage during catheter placement while avoiding damage to the adjacent organs, for example bladder, rectum and bowel. In the study, two independent experiments were performed on a phantom model to evaluate the targeting accuracy of an electromagnetic (EM) tracking system. The procedure was carried out using a laptop computer (2.1GHz Intel Core i7 computer, 8GB RAM, Windows 7 64-bit), an EM Aurora tracking system with a 1.3mm diameter 6 DOF sensor, and 6F (2 mm) brachytherapy catheters inserted through a Syed-Neblett applicator. The 3D Slicer and PLUS open source software were used to develop the system. The mean of the targeting error was less than 2.9mm, which is comparable to the targeting errors in commercial clinical navigation systems.},

  Abstract                 = {IMPORTANCE Increased use of computed tomography (CT) in pediatrics raises concerns about cancer risk from exposure to ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVES To quantify trends in the use of CT in pediatrics and the associated radiation exposure and cancer risk. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. SETTING Seven US health care systems. PARTICIPANTS The use of CT was evaluated for children younger than 15 years of age from 1996 to 2010, including 4 857 736 child-years of observation. Radiation doses were calculated for 744 CT scans performed between 2001 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rates of CT use, organ and effective doses, and projected lifetime attributable risks of cancer. RESULTS The use of CT doubled for children younger than 5 years of age and tripled for children 5 to 14 years of age between 1996 and 2005, remained stable between 2006 and 2007, and then began to decline. Effective doses varied from 0.03 to 69.2 mSv per scan. An effective dose of 20 mSv or higher was delivered by 14\% to 25\% of abdomen/pelvis scans, 6\% to 14\% of spine scans, and 3\% to 8\% of chest scans. Projected lifetime attributable risks of solid cancer were higher for younger patients and girls than for older patients and boys, and they were also higher for patients who underwent CT scans of the abdomen/pelvis or spine than for patients who underwent other types of CT scans. For girls, a radiation-induced solid cancer is projected to result from every 300 to 390 abdomen/pelvis scans, 330 to 480 chest scans, and 270 to 800 spine scans, depending on age. The risk of leukemia was highest from head scans for children younger than 5 years of age at a rate of 1.9 cases per 10 000 CT scans. Nationally, 4 million pediatric CT scans of the head, abdomen/pelvis, chest, or spine performed each year are projected to cause 4870 future cancers. Reducing the highest 25\% of doses to the median might prevent 43\% of these cancers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The increased use of CT in pediatrics, combined with the wide variability in radiation doses, has resulted in many children receiving a high-dose examination. Dose-reduction strategies targeted to the highest quartile of doses could dramatically reduce the number of radiation-induced cancers.},

  Abstract                 = {Freehand three-dimensional ultrasound imaging (3D-US) is increasingly used in image-guided surgery. During image acquisition, a set of B-scans is acquired that is distributed in a non-parallel manner over the area of interest. Reconstructing these images into a regular array allows 3D visualization. However, the reconstruction process may introduce artefacts and may therefore reduce image quality. The aim of the study is to compare different algorithms with respect to image quality and diagnostic value for image guidance in neurosurgery.3D-US data sets were acquired during surgery of various intracerebral lesions using an integrated ultrasound-navigation device. They were stored for post-hoc evaluation. Five different reconstruction algorithms, a standard multiplanar reconstruction with interpolation (MPR), a pixel nearest neighbour method (PNN), a voxel nearest neighbour method (VNN) and two voxel based distance-weighted algorithms (VNN2 and DW) were tested with respect to image quality and artefact formation. The capability of the algorithm to fill gaps within the sample volume was investigated and a clinical evaluation with respect to the diagnostic value of the reconstructed images was performed.MPR was significantly worse than the other algorithms in filling gaps. In an image subtraction test, VNN2 and DW reliably reconstructed images even if large amounts of data were missing. However, the quality of the reconstruction improved, if data acquisition was performed in a structured manner. When evaluating the diagnostic value of reconstructed axial, sagittal and coronal views, VNN2 and DW were judged to be significantly better than MPR and VNN.VNN2 and DW could be identified as robust algorithms that generate reconstructed US images with a high diagnostic value. These algorithms improve the utility and reliability of 3D-US imaging during intraoperative navigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Calibration is essential in freehand 3-D ultrasound to find the spatial transformation from the image coordinates to the sensor coordinate system. Calibration accuracy has significant impact on image-guided interventions. We introduce a new mathematical framework that uses differential measurements to achieve high calibration accuracy. Accurate measurements of axial differences in ultrasound images of a multi-wedge phantom are used to calculate the calibration matrix with a closed-form solution. The multi-wedge phantom has been designed based on the proposed differential framework and can be mass-produced inexpensively using a 3-D printer. The proposed method enables easy, fast and highly accurate ultrasound calibration, which is essential for most current ultrasound-guided applications and also widens the range of new applications. The precision of the method using only a single image of the phantom is comparable to that of the standard N-wire method using 50 images. The method can also directly take advantage of the fine sampling rate of radiofrequency ultrasound data to achieve very high calibration accuracy. With 100 radiofrequency ultrasound images, the method achieves a point reconstruction error of 0.09 ± 0.39 mm.},

  Abstract                 = {This article discusses the design features of an interactive system for acquiring, analyzing, and displaying volume sonographic patient data. Methods for reprojection of two-dimensional (2D) sonographic image data into a volume matrix are discussed. We describe an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface that facilitates physician operation of a system incorporating an interactive volume renderer for optimization of viewing orientation and data presentation and incorporates stereoscopic viewing. Visualization methods are described that permit the operator interactively to extract tissues or organs of interest from the rest of the volume scanned. Selected examples of clinical images are given to demonstrate system capability. The system represents a cost-effective 3D ultrasound system integrating clinical scanners and graphics workstations. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {To use a PC-based virtual ultrasound scanner (VirUS) in the investigation of inter- and intraoperator nuchal translucency (NT) thickness measurement repeatability of experienced ultrasound operators.Realistic fetal ultrasound images of defined NT thickness were simulated with VirUS with emulation of scanner gain and time-gain compensation and gain-dependent echo size changes. A set of 50 images was generated with uniformly distributed NT thickness (range, 1-5 mm at 1-mm intervals) and translucency angle (mean +/- standard deviation of +/- 2.52 degrees +/- 1.85 degrees about the horizontal). Operators (n = 13) measured NT thickness in the image set on three occasions separated by at least 1 day, giving 150 measurements per operator (total measurements, 1950).Inter- and intraoperator repeatabilities were +/- 0.41 mm and +/- 0.22 mm, respectively (at the 95\% confidence level). There were significant correlations between repeatability and mean measured NT thickness (r = - 0.72, P = 0.005 at 4-mm interval), between gain and mean measured NT thickness (P </= 0.002, n = 8/13) and between gain and repeatability coefficient (P < 0.01, n = 6/13).VirUS provides a consistent NT audit environment and demonstrates the need to both optimize repeatability vs. mean measured thickness and to set gain consistently. The technique has potential in operator training.},

  Abstract                 = {Four-dimensional imaging is a necessary step in computer-assisted interventions (CAI) performed on moving surgical targets, such as those located within the beating heart or influenced by respiratory motion. Ultrasound (US) is often the best imaging modality for this application, as it provides good contrast and spatial resolution while remaining simple to integrate into the operating room. However, conventional 2D US imaging is often insufficient for preoperative planning and surgical guidance, real-time 3D ultrasound imaging using matrix array probes has a smaller field of view and lower spatial resolution, and 3D volumes created using 3D US reconstruction suffer from motion artifacts. As an alternative, gated 4D ultrasound reconstruction using a tracked 2D US probe is a promising technology. In this paper, we present SynchroGrab4D to the open-source community. SynchroGrab4D performs 3D and 4D US reconstruction in real-time while visualizing the output volume(s) within an OpenIGTLink-compliant CAI system, such as 3D Slicer. Also included are VTK classes that perform ECG-gating and that interface with several commercial tracking systems, as well as a 4D Imaging module in 3D Slicer. Our open-source imaging system can be used to collect the 4D image data required for computer-assisted surgical planning and intraoperative guidance for a variety of moving organs.},

To enable TRUS simulation, data from ultrasound prostate imaging of eight real patients obtained with our regular ultrasound machine were transferred to the simulator by connecting the computer of the simulator to the ultrasound machine. These data were used to create images in the TRUS simulator. Residents and urologists used the simulator to perform TRUS in one of the eight patient cases and judged the simulator's realism and usefulness.: We were able to construct an initial urological module for the TRUS simulator. The images shown on the monitor of the simulator are quite realistic. The simulator can be used without difficulty to collect data, to create cases, and to perform TRUS. The absence of an option for prostate biopsy and the lack of tissue resistance were mentioned as two important shortcomings. Forty-seven participants rated the simulator's overall realism and usefulness for training purposes as 3.8 (standard deviation: 0.7) and 4.0 (standard deviation: 0.8) on a five-point Likert scale, respectively.: The simulator we describe can be used as a training tool for TRUS. It enables training with different patient cases and minimizes the burden to patients. Simulation of prostate biopsies should be added to increase the model's usefulness.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional freehand three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound is a multi-stage process. First, the clinician scans the area of interest. Next, the ultrasound data is used to construct a 3-D voxel array, which can then be visualized by, for example, any-plane slicing. The strict separation of data acquisition and visualization disturbs the interactive nature of the ultrasound examination. Furthermore, some systems require the clinician to wait for an unacceptable amount of time while the voxel array is constructed. In this paper, we describe a novel freehand 3-D ultrasound system which allows accurate acquisition of the raw data and immediate visualization of arbitrary slices through the data. Minimal processing separates the acquisition and visualization processes: in particular, at no stage is a voxel array constructed. Instead, the standard graphics hardware found inside most desktop computers is exploited to synthesize arbitrary slices directly from the raw B-scans.},

  Abstract                 = {3-D freehand ultrasound is a new imaging technique that is rapidly finding clinical applications. A position-sensing device is attached to a conventional ultrasound probe so that, as B-scans are acquired, they can be labelled with their relative positions and orientations. This allows a 3-D data set to be constructed from the B-scans. A key requirement of all freehand imaging systems is calibration; that is, determining the position and orientation of the B-scan with respect to the position sensor. This is typically a lengthy and tedious process that may need repeating every time a sensor is mounted on a probe. This paper describes a new calibration technique that takes only a few minutes to perform and produces results that compare favourably (in terms of both accuracy and precision) with previously published alternatives.},

  Abstract                 = {Segmentation of the spinal column from Computed Tomography (CT) images is a pre-processing step for a range of image-guided interventions. One intervention that would benefit from accurate segmentation is spinal needle injection. Previous spinal segmentation techniques have primarily focused on identification and separate segmentation of each vertebra. Recently, statistical multi-object shape models have been introduced to extract common statistical characteristics between several anatomies. These models can be used for segmentation purposes because they are robust, accurate, and computationally tractable. In this paper, we develop a statistical multivertebrae shape+pose model and propose a novel registrationbased technique to segment the CT images of spine. The multivertebrae statistical model captures the variations in shape and pose simultaneously, which reduces the number of registration parameters. We validate our technique in terms of accuracy and robustness of multi-vertebrae segmentation of CT images acquired from lumbar vertebrae of 32 subjects. The mean error of the proposed technique is below 2 mm, which is sufficient for many spinal needle injection procedures, such as facet joint injections.},

Most standard reconstruction algorithms are designed to minimize computational requirements and do not exploit the underlying shape of the data. We investigate whether an approximation with splines holds any promise as a better reconstruction method. A radial basis function approximation method is implemented and compared with three standard methods. While the radial basis approach is computationally expensive, it produces accurate reconstructions without the kind of visible artefacts common with the standard methods. The other potential advantages of radial basis functions, such as the direct computation of derivatives, make further investigation worthwhile.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a new robust and fully automatic method for calibration of three-dimensional (3D) freehand ultrasound called Confhusius (CalibratiON for FreeHand UltraSound Imaging USage). 3D Freehand ultrasound consists in mounting a position sensor on a standard probe. The echographic B-scans can be localized in 3D and compounded into a volume. However, especially for quantitative use, this process dramatically requires a calibration procedure that determines its accuracy and usefulness. Calibration aims at determining the transformation (translations, rotations, scaling) between the coordinates system of the echographic images and the coordinate system of the localization system. To calibrate, we acquire images of a phantom whose 3D geometrical properties are known. We propose a robust and fully automatic calibration method based on the Hough transform and robust estimators. Experiments have been done with synthetic and real sequences, and this calibration method is shown to be easy to perform, accurate, automatic and fast enough for clinical use.},

  Abstract                 = {Freehand 3D ultrasound is increasingly being introduced in the clinic for diagnostics and image-assisted interventions. Various algorithms exist for combining 2D images of regular ultrasound probes to 3D volumes, being either voxel-, pixel- or function-based. Previously, the most commonly used input to 3D ultrasound reconstruction has been digitized analog video. However, recent scanners that offer access to digital image frames exist, either as processed or unprocessed data. To our knowledge, no comparison has been performed to determine which data source gives the best reconstruction quality. In the present study we compared both reconstruction algorithms and data sources using novel comparison methods for detecting potential differences in image quality of the reconstructed volumes. The ultrasound scanner used in this study was the Sonix RP from Ultrasonix Medical Corp (Richmond, Canada), a scanner that allow third party access to unprocessed and processed digital data. The ultrasound probe used was the L14-5/38 linear probe. The assessment is based on a number of image criteria: detectability of wire targets, spatial resolution, detectability of small barely visible structures, subjective tissue image quality, and volume geometry. In addition we have also performed the more "traditional" comparison of reconstructed volumes by removing a percentage of the input data. By using these evaluation methods and data from the specific scanner, the results showed that the processed video performed better than the digital scan-line data, digital video being better than analog video. Furthermore, the results showed that the choice of video source was more important than the choice of tested reconstruction algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) is increasingly being introduced in the clinic, both for diagnostics and image guidance. Although dedicated 3D US probes exist, 3D US can also be acquired with the still frequently used two-dimensional (2D) US probes. Obtaining 3D volumes with 2D US probes is a two-step process. First, a positioning sensor must be attached to the probe; second, a reconstruction of a 3D volume can be performed into a regular voxel grid. Various algorithms have been used for performing 3D reconstruction based on 2D images. Up till now, a complete overview of the algorithms, the way they work and their benefits and drawbacks due to various applications has been missing. The lack of an overview is made clear by confusions about algorithm and group names in the existing literature. This article is a review aimed at explaining and categorizing the various algorithms into groups, according to algorithm implementation. The algorithms are compared based on published data and our own laboratory results. Positive and practical uses of the various algorithms for different applications are discussed, with a focus on image guidance.},

  Abstract                 = {Sonographic training in obstetrics differs broadly in Germany, although there are clearly defined quality-oriented requirements. In order to improve professional education, a training concept was devised utilizing an ultrasound simulator system.Between October 2004 and May 2006, 100 obstetric ultrasound training courses were held in 12 federal states of Germany. In these daily courses, doctors were trained in the detection of the most common malformations.One hundred training courses with a total of 1,266 participants.As a measure of quality assurance, a standardized questionnaire focusing on testing sonographic proficiency before and after the courses was issued in order to analyze the effect of these simulator-based ultrasound courses.Effectiveness of the method with reference to its potential role in structured sonographic training.The concept found prevailing approval (90\%) at the level of principle, practical implementation, and clinical usefulness. Of the participants, 91\% estimated their subjective training effect as good. The questionnaire analysis showed significant improvement. On average, 75.3\% of the questions relating to sonographic proficiency were answered correctly at the end of the course as opposed to 48.6\% at the beginning.Structured ultrasound training courses based on an ultrasound simulator system seem to be useful for defining a basic standardized quality of training and significantly improving examiners' skills. This is a suitable additional instrument to improve the education in obstetric ultrasound.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a high-definition freehand 3-D ultrasound (US) system, with accuracy surpassing that of previously documented systems. 3-D point location accuracy within a US data set can be achieved to within 0.5 mm. Such accuracy is possible through a series of novel system-design and calibration techniques. The accuracy is quantified using a purpose-built tissue-mimicking phantom, designed to create realistic clinical conditions without compromising the accuracy of the measurement procedure. The paper includes a thorough discussion of the various ways of measuring system accuracy and their relative merits; and compares, in this context, all recently documented freehand 3-D US systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring spinal curvature in adolescent kyphoscoliosis requires regular radiographic examinations; however, the applied ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer. Ultrasound imaging is favored over radiography because it does not emit ionizing radiation. Therefore, we tested an ultrasound system for spinal curvature measurement, with the help of spatial tracking of the ultrasound transducer. Tracked ultrasound was used to localize vertebral transverse processes as landmarks along the spine to measure curvature angles. The method was tested in two scoliotic spine models by localizing the same landmarks using both ultrasound and radiographic imaging and comparing the angles obtained. A close correlation was found between tracked ultrasound and radiographic curvature measurements. Differences between results of the two methods were 1.27 ± 0.84° (average ± SD) in an adult model and 0.96 ± 0.87° in a pediatric model. Our results suggest that tracked ultrasound may become a more tolerable and more accessible alternative to radiographic spine monitoring in adolescent kyphoscoliosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) requires extensive hands-on training, and it is for this purpose we have designed EchoComTEE, a simulator for TOE. It consists of a manikin and dummy probe; according to the position of the dummy probe (tracked by an electromagnetic sensor), two-dimensional (2D) images are calculated from three-dimensional (3D) data sets. Echocardiographic images are presented side-by-side with a virtual scene consisting of a 3D heart, probe tip and image plane. In this way the trainee is provided with visual feed-back of the relationship between echocardiogram and image plane position. We evaluated the simulator using a standardised questionnaire. Twenty-five experts and 31 novice users participated in the study. Most experts graded the simulator as realistic and all recommended its use for training. Most novice users felt the simulator supported spatial orientation during TOE and, as anaesthetists often do not have training in transthoracic echocardiography, in this group the TOE simulator might be particularly useful.},

MRI is costly and CT exposes the patients to ionizing radiation. Ultrasound, on the other hand, is affordable and safe. The long-term goal of our work is to enable the use of multiparametric ultrasound imaging in image-guided HDR for cervical cancer. In this paper, we report the development of enabling technology for ultrasound guidance and tissue typing. We report a system to obtain the 3D freehand transabdominal ultrasound RF signals and B-mode images of the uterus, and a method for registration of ultrasound to MRI. MRI and 3D ultrasound images of the female pelvis were registered by contouring the uterus in the two modalities, creating a surface model, followed by rigid and B-spline deformable registration. The resulting transformation was used to map the location of the tumor from the T2-weighted MRI to ultrasound images and to determine cancerous and normal areas in ultrasound. B-mode images show a contrast for cancer vs. normal tissue. Our study shows the potential and the challenges of ultrasound imaging in guiding cervical cancer treatments.},
