	This is reverse-tri-linear interpolation. A single pixel is distributed

	This is implemented in our software, though reconstructions do not
	turn out as nice when we apply hole-filling with this, possibly because
	of unequal weighting.
	
	The last few paragraphs of 2.1 are interesting: they use the same
	ultrasound resolutions as us, but claim that hole-less is easy to
	accomplish. This isn't an RBF but could be with a larger kernel (not
	too sure about this last point, reread later?)},

  abstract = {Echography is a useful tool to diagnose a thrombosis; however, since
	it is difficult to learn to perform this procedure, the objective
	of this work is to create a simulation to allow students to practice
	in a virtual environment. Firstly, a physical model of the thigh
	was constructed based on experimental data obtained using a force
	sensor mounted on a robotic arm. We present a spring damper model
	consisting of both linear and non-linear elements. The parameters
	of each of these elements are then fitted to the experimental data
	using an optimization technique. By employing an implicit integration
	to solve the dynamics of the system we obtain a stable physical simulation
	at over 100 Hz. Secondly, a haptic interface was added to interact
	with the simulation. Using a PHANToM force-feedback device may touch
	and deform the thigh in real-time. In order to allow a realistic
	sensation of the contact we employ a local modeling technique allowing
	to approximate the forces at much higher frequency using a multi-threaded
	architecture. Finally, we present the basis for a fast echographic
	image generation depending on the position and orientation of the
	virtual probe as well as the force applied to it.},

  abstract = {Four-dimensional imaging is a necessary step in computer-assisted
	interventions (CAI) performed on moving surgical targets, such as
	those located within the beating heart or influenced by respiratory
	motion. Ultrasound (US) is often the best imaging modality for this
	application, as it provides good contrast and spatial resolution
	while remaining simple to integrate into the operating room. However,
	conventional 2D US imaging is often insufficient for preoperative
	planning and surgical guidance, real-time 3D ultrasound imaging using
	matrix array probes has a smaller field of view and lower spatial
	resolution, and 3D volumes created using 3D US reconstruction suffer
	from motion artifacts. As an alternative, gated 4D ultrasound reconstruction
	using a tracked 2D US probe is a promising technology. In this paper,
	we present SynchroGrab4D to the open-source community. SynchroGrab4D
	performs 3D and 4D US reconstruction in real-time while visualizing
	the output volume(s) within an OpenIGTLink-compliant CAI system,
	such as 3D Slicer. Also included are VTK classes that perform ECG-gating
	and that interface with several commercial tracking systems, as well
	as a 4D Imaging module in 3D Slicer. Our open-source imaging system
	can be used to collect the 4D image data required for computer-assisted
	surgical planning and intraoperative guidance for a variety of moving

  abstract = {Although ultrasound has become an important imaging modality within
	several medical professions, the benefit of ultrasound depends to
	some degree on the skills of the person operating the probe and interpreting

	is considered an alternative approach for learning basic skills.
	To ensure the quality of simulator-based training, it is important
	to produce simulated ultrasound images that resemble true images
	to a sufficient degree. This article describes a method that allows
	corresponding true and simulated ultrasound images to be generated
	and displayed side by side in real time, thus facilitating an interactive
	evaluation of ultrasound simulators in terms of image resemblance,
	real-time characteristics and man-machine interaction. The proposed

	being a valuable tool in the development of simulation algorithms.},

	It represents an anatomical region which may be investigated. Furthermore,
	a method for the geometric registration of the data volume of a new

  abstract = {We present a groupwise US to CT registration algorithm for guiding
	percutaneous spinal interventions. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive
	validation scheme that accounts for changes in the curvature of the
	spine between preoperative and intraoperative imaging. In our registration
	methodology, each vertebra in CT is treated as a sub-volume and transformed
	individually. A biomechanical model is used to constrain the displacement
	of the vertebrae relative to one another. The sub-volumes are then
	reconstructed into a single volume. During each iteration of registration,
	an US image is simulated from the reconstructed CT volume and an
	intensity-based similarity metric is calculated with the real US
	image. Validation studies are performed on CT and US images from
	a sheep cadaver, five patient-based phantoms designed to preserve
	realistic curvatures of the spine and a sixth patient-based phantom
	where the curvature of the spine is changed between preoperative
	and intraoperative imaging. For datasets where the spine curve between
	two imaging modalities was artificially perturbed, the proposed methodology
	was able to register initial misalignments of up to 20mm with a success
	rate of 95\%. For the phantom with a physical change in the curvature
	of the spine introduced between the US and CT datasets, the registration
	success rate was 98.5\%. Finally, the registration success rate for
	the sheep cadaver with soft-tissue information was 87\%. The results
	demonstrate that our algorithm allows for robust registration of
	US and CT datasets, regardless of a change in the patients pose between
	preoperative and intraoperative image acquisitions.},

	measure of the quality of alignment within the volume and is minimized

  abstract = {Z-fiducial phantoms allow three-dimensional ultrasound probe calibration
	with a single B-scan. One of the main difficulties in using this
	phantom is the need for reliable segmentation of the wires in the
	ultrasound images, which necessitates manual intervention. In this
	article, we have shown how we can solve this problem by mounting
	a thin rubber membrane on top of the phantom. The membrane is segmented
	automatically and the wires can be easily located as they are at
	known positions relative to the membrane. This enables us to segment
	the wires automatically at the full PAL frame rate of 25 Hz, to produce
	calibrations in real-time, while achieving accuracies similar to
	those reported in the literature. We have also devised a technique
	to improve the estimation of the elevational offset (calibration
	parameter) by capturing a few images of the planar membrane. If spatial
	calibration is known, fully automatic wire segmentation allows the
	fiducials to be tracked in real-time. This also enables temporal
	calibration to be performed in real-time as the probe is moved away
	from the phantom. We have evaluated the performance of our phantom
	by calibrating a probe at 8 cm and 15 cm depth. The precision of
	the calibrations are 0.7 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. The point reconstruction
	accuracies of fiducial points provided by the same Z-phantom are
	slightly below 1.5 mm. The point reconstruction accuracies obtained
	by scanning the end of a wire tip are 2.5 mm and 3.0 mm. These results
	match the accuracies achieved in the literature. It takes approximately
	2 min to set up the experiment, submerge the phantom in the water
	bath, locate the phantom in space with a pointer and capture six
	images of the planar membrane. After this, spatial calibration can
	be performed in less than a second. Temporal calibration can be completed
	in approximately 3 s.},

  abstract = {Medical ultrasound imaging has been in clinical use for decades, however,
	acquisition
	
	and interpretation of ultrasound images still requires experience.
	For this reason, ultrasound
	
	simulation for training purposes is gaining importance. Additionally,
	simulated images can
	
	be used for the multimodal registration of Ultrasound and Computed
	Tomography (CT)
	
	images. The simulation process is a computationally demanding task.
	Thus, in this thesis a
	
	simulation method, accelerated by modern graphics hardware (GPU),
	is introduced.
	
	
	The accelerated simulation utilizes a ray-based simulation model in
	order to provide realtime
	
	high-throughput image simulation for training and registration purposes.
	Wave-based
	
	simulation methods are computationally even more demanding and have
	been considered
	
	unsuitable for real-time applications. In the scope of this thesis,
	wave-based models have
	
	been investigated, including the Digital Waveguide Mesh and the Finite-Difference
	Time-
	
	Domain method for solvingWestervelt’s equation. Initial results demonstrate
	the feasibility
	
	of performing near real-time wave-based ultrasound simulation using
	graphics hardware.
	
	
	Furthermore, a new algorithm is introduced for volumetric reconstruction
	of freehand
	
	(3D) ultrasound. The proposed algorithm intelligently divides the
	work between CPU and
	
	GPU for optimal performance. The results demonstrate superior performance

	both spatial and temporal parameters. The main advantage of this
	method is that it does not require a phantom, which is usually expensive
	to fabricate. Furthermore, the method does not require extensive
	image processing. For spatial calibration, we solve an optimization
	problem established by a set of equations that relate the orientations
	of a line (i.e., calibration pointer) to the intersection points
	appearing in the ultrasound image. The line orientation is provided
	through calibration of both ends of the calibration pointer. Temporal
	calibration is achieved by processing of the captured pointer orientations
	and the corresponding image positions of intersection along with
	the timing information. The effectiveness of the unified method for
	both spatial and temporal calibration is apparent from the quality
	of the 3D reconstructions of a known object.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound has become indispensable in prenatal diagnosis. Ultrasound
	training, however, still lacks proper quality assessment and control.
	Moreover, most fetal anomalies which must be diagnosed during pregnancy
	are extremely rare. Ultrasound simulators could provide an opportunity
	to overcome this dilemma. This review summarizes the potential benefits
	of simulator-based ultrasound training, briefly describes the properties
	of a variety of ultrasound simulators that have been developed for
	various applications including prenatal diagnosis, and presents the
	SonoTrainer sonography simulation system which makes it possible
	to run a real-time simulation of a complete prenatal ultrasound examination.
	We evaluated the system for the training of first- and second-trimester
	screening for both normal and pathological findings and found that
	physicians who received theoretical training and were additionally
	trained with the simulator (T + S) significantly improved their skills
	in measurements of nuchal translucency thickness (NT) and crown-rump
	length (CRL) as compared with colleagues who only underwent theoretical
	instruction (T) [mean +/- SD NT deviation: 0.31 +/- 0.1 mm (T + S)
	vs. 0.62 +/- 0.2 mm (T), P < 0.05; mean +/- SD CRL deviation: 1.48
	+/- 2.0 mm (T + S) vs. 3.27 +/- 2.5 (T), P < 0.05]. Simulator-based
	training enabled physicians to diagnose rare fetal anomalies in the
	second trimester with a sensitivity of 86\% and a specificity of
	100\%. In a study in which second-trimester scans including fetal
	anomalies were presented to physicians, 96\% of the participants
	subjectively estimated their training effect as being good. We therefore
	conclude that simulator-based training would provide an ideal educational
	tool to test, improve and monitor a physician's or technician's ultrasound
	skills in detecting fetal anomalies.},

	To enable TRUS simulation, data from ultrasound prostate imaging
	of eight real patients obtained with our regular ultrasound machine

	simulator's realism and usefulness.: We were able to construct an
	initial urological module for the TRUS simulator. The images shown
	on the monitor of the simulator are quite realistic. The simulator
	can be used without difficulty to collect data, to create cases,
	and to perform TRUS. The absence of an option for prostate biopsy
	and the lack of tissue resistance were mentioned as two important
	shortcomings. Forty-seven participants rated the simulator's overall
	realism and usefulness for training purposes as 3.8 (standard deviation:

	minimizes the burden to patients. Simulation of prostate biopsies

  abstract = {3-D freehand ultrasound is a new imaging technique that is rapidly
	finding clinical applications. A position-sensing device is attached
	to a conventional ultrasound probe so that, as B-scans are acquired,
	they can be labelled with their relative positions and orientations.
	This allows a 3-D data set to be constructed from the B-scans. A
	key requirement of all freehand imaging systems is calibration; that
	is, determining the position and orientation of the B-scan with respect
	to the position sensor. This is typically a lengthy and tedious process
	that may need repeating every time a sensor is mounted on a probe.
	This paper describes a new calibration technique that takes only
	a few minutes to perform and produces results that compare favourably
	(in terms of both accuracy and precision) with previously published
	alternatives.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new robust and fully automatic method for calibration
	of three-dimensional (3D) freehand ultrasound called Confhusius (CalibratiON
	for FreeHand UltraSound Imaging USage). 3D Freehand ultrasound consists
	in mounting a position sensor on a standard probe. The echographic
	B-scans can be localized in 3D and compounded into a volume. However,
	especially for quantitative use, this process dramatically requires
	a calibration procedure that determines its accuracy and usefulness.
	Calibration aims at determining the transformation (translations,
	rotations, scaling) between the coordinates system of the echographic
	images and the coordinate system of the localization system. To calibrate,
	we acquire images of a phantom whose 3D geometrical properties are
	known. We propose a robust and fully automatic calibration method
	based on the Hough transform and robust estimators. Experiments have
	been done with synthetic and real sequences, and this calibration
	method is shown to be easy to perform, accurate, automatic and fast
	enough for clinical use.},

	for diagnostics and image-assisted interventions. Various algorithms
	exist for combining 2D images of regular ultrasound probes to 3D
	volumes, being either voxel-, pixel- or function-based. Previously,
	the most commonly used input to 3D ultrasound reconstruction has
	been digitized analog video. However, recent scanners that offer
	access to digital image frames exist, either as processed or unprocessed
	data. To our knowledge, no comparison has been performed to determine

	study we compared both reconstruction algorithms and data sources
	using novel comparison methods for detecting potential differences
	in image quality of the reconstructed volumes. The ultrasound scanner
	used in this study was the Sonix RP from Ultrasonix Medical Corp
	(Richmond, Canada), a scanner that allow third party access to unprocessed
	and processed digital data. The ultrasound probe used was the L14-5/38
	linear probe. The assessment is based on a number of image criteria:
	detectability of wire targets, spatial resolution, detectability
	of small barely visible structures, subjective tissue image quality,
	and volume geometry. In addition we have also performed the more
	"traditional" comparison of reconstructed volumes by removing a percentage
	of the input data. By using these evaluation methods and data from
	the specific scanner, the results showed that the processed video
	performed better than the digital scan-line data, digital video being
	better than analog video. Furthermore, the results showed that the
	choice of video source was more important than the choice of tested
	reconstruction algorithms.},

  abstract = {Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) requires extensive hands-on
	training, and it is for this purpose we have designed EchoComTEE,
	a simulator for TOE. It consists of a manikin and dummy probe; according
	to the position of the dummy probe (tracked by an electromagnetic
	sensor), two-dimensional (2D) images are calculated from three-dimensional
	(3D) data sets. Echocardiographic images are presented side-by-side
	with a virtual scene consisting of a 3D heart, probe tip and image
	plane. In this way the trainee is provided with visual feed-back
	of the relationship between echocardiogram and image plane position.
	We evaluated the simulator using a standardised questionnaire. Twenty-five
	experts and 31 novice users participated in the study. Most experts
	graded the simulator as realistic and all recommended its use for
	training. Most novice users felt the simulator supported spatial
	orientation during TOE and, as anaesthetists often do not have training
	in transthoracic echocardiography, in this group the TOE simulator
	might be particularly useful.},
